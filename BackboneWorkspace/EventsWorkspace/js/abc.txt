# generator-csui-extension

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for CS UI extensions

## Pre-requisites

The following tools have to be installed, before you start:

* NodeJS 4 or newer
* Python 2 (the most recent 2.x)
* Git
* Grunt command line tool:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Getting Started

Install the generator globally. Do not delete the directory, where you unpack
the generator package:

```bash
npm install -g yo

unzip generator-csui-extension.zip
cd generator-csui-extension
npm link
```

Generate a new project (*verify that you are not in the
`generator-csui-extension` directory*):

```bash
mkdir my-extension
cd my-extension
yo csui-extension
```

Build the generated project:

```bash
grunt
```

## Adding Content

You can add a new widget with a sample model, factory and view, which you can
start with and modify according to your goal, by the `widget` sub-generator:

```bash
yo csui-extension:widget
```

Rebuild the updated project:

```bash
grunt
```

You also can copy samples from the CS UI SDK into this project and follow the
respective documentation.
